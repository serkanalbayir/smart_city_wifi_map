First of all, after examining the map and the road, I decided on which route and how long a road would be drawn. I determined my route from Atatepe car park as a day hospital. Then I realized that it is possible to pass through the L block garden of the student houses and I decided to draw this road. After that, the technical parts started.

I made the planned road drawing in the beytepe_roads_rev2 layer. I named this path 1001

I calculated and checked the path(1001) on QGIS.

After this digitization i saved the data and updated the database.

When I checked the database, the road with id 1001 was added without any problem and our beytepe_roads_rev2 table was updated.

Then, when we renewed our localhost and selected our start and end point according to the route, our new path was added.

I have attached the image of the old road at the bottom of this post.

Link to the article I was looking for: https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/05/soofa-benches-collecting-data-from-cellphones-in-downtown-newmarket.html

Residents and visitors near a Soofa bench with their Wi-Fi-enabled devices, including smartphones and tablets, are recognized by the thin piece of technology whether or not the device is plugged into the Soofa via the USB charging cable. Then, charging and internet access can be provided on this bank. Considering some of the systems that are carried out online in recent times, this application has a great role in helping students continue their responsibilities and education without interruption. As the size of internet access and the possibility of charging digital devices increase, the efficiency of students and all people on campus increases.

The map I prepared for this application.
